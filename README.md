# Information about me
## G'day there!
- My name is Ryan and I haven't the faintest what to write here so **HEY** meet me. 👋✌
- I am 21 and somehow legally allowed to have a say in politics (I reckon that was a bad idea). 👮‍♂️🌏
- Yeah I'm proudly Aussie, the snakes kill. Oh and the drop bears.. Don't get me started on them. 🕷 🐍
- I'm more of a Graphial Designer & Code Debugger then a Programmer, though I like to dabble occasionally. 👨‍💻🐱‍💻
